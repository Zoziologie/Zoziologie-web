intro: 
  - excerpt: 'Wonder what the name means? <br>**Zoziologie** goes back to my childhood, when my brother made fun of my passion for birds ("oiseaux" in French) by calling it "zozio". As I grew older and pursued scientific studies, I tried to combine my passion with birds (zozio) with my scientific background (logos), that gave birth to a new discpline: zoziologie!'
